### Requirements

- Node.js 20+ and npm. You can install it by running:

```sh
nvm install 20.12.2 && nvm use 20.12.2
```

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/paalamugan/next14-biolerplate-with-next-auth.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name
pnpm install
```

#### Prerequisites

- Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and update the environment variables with your own values.

```shell
cp .env.example .env.local
```

and update the environment variables with your own values.

Then, you can run the project locally in development mode with live reload by executing:

### Customization

You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate by making a search in the whole project with `FIXME:` for making quick customization. Here is some of the most important files to customize:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your website favicon, you can generate from [https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)
- `src/constants/appConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/templates/BaseTemplate.tsx`: default theme
- `next.config.mjs`: Next.js configuration
- `.env`: default environment variables

You have access to the whole code source if you need further customization. The provided code is only example for you to start your project. The sky is the limit 🚀.

### Commit Message Format

The project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This means that all your commit messages must be formatted according to the specification. To help you write commit messages, the project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
pnpm commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is that it allows us to automatically generate a `CHANGELOG` file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Testing

All unit tests are located with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. The project uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing. You can run the tests with:

```shell
pnpm test
```

### Integration & E2E Testing

The project uses Playwright for Integration and E2E testing. You can run the tests with:

```shell
npx playwright install # Only for the first time in a new environment
pnpm test:e2e
```

### Enable Edge runtime (optional)

The App Router folder is compatible with the Edge runtime. You can enable it by uncommenting the following lines `src/app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
// export const runtime = 'edge';
```

### Deploy to production

Then, you can generate a production build with:

```shell
pnpm build
```

It generates an optimized production build of the boilerplate. For testing the generated build, you can run:

```shell
pnpm start
```

The command starts a local server with the production build. Then, you can now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your favorite browser to see the project.

### Useful commands

#### Bundle Analyzer

Next.js Boilerplate comes with a built-in bundle analyzer. It can be used to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles. To begin, run the following command:

```shell
pnpm build-stats
```

By running the command, it'll automatically open a new browser window with the results.

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed on your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and show you the errors. Same goes for testing, you can install VSCode Jest extension to automatically run your tests and it also show the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with `Cmd` + `Shift` + `B` on Mac.
